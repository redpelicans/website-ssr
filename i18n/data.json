    "technologies.JavaScript2.h1": "What is Full Stack JavaScript?",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.p1": "We are currently witnessing two major changes on the software development industry which lead to a certitude:<br /><q>JavaScript will rule the world (wide web).</q>",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.p2": "The whole offers an extremely competitive Full Stack JavaScript ecosystem compared to existings solutions like .net, Java, Ruby or Python.<br /><br />You want to use technologies that allow for rapid development, constant iteration, maximal efficiency, speed, robustness and more.<br /><q>You want to be lean and you want to be agile.</q><br />You want to use technologies that will help you succeed in the short and long term.<br /><br /><q>Full Stack JavaScript hits all the marks.</q>",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.content.h1": "Rise of the client",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.content.p1": "The browser becomes the evident and trusted execution platform.<br />More and more functionality has moved to the client along with the rise of client-side frameworks which heavily rely on JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.<br />This process is not new but solutions (like React and D3.js) are now mature and ready for serious business.",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.content.h2": "Back on the server",
    "technologies.JavaScript2.content.p2": "JavaScript is back on the server.<br />This isn't a new phenomenon; Netscape already stuck JavaScript in the server way back in 1996. The emergence of new frameworks like Node.js or the new breed of NOSQL databases like MongoDB are likely to prove that JavaScript, given the quality and speed of resulting apps, is about to become a major server-side language.",
    "technologies.nosql.h": "NoSQL",
    "technologies.nosql.p": "MongoDB",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p1": "A NoSQL database environment is a non-relational and largely distributed database system that enables rapid, ad-hoc organization and analysis of extremely high-volume, disparate data types.<br /><br /><q>Big Data is one of the key forces driving the growth and popularity of NoSQL for business.</q><br />The almost limitless array of data collection technologies ranging from simple online actions to point of sale systems to GPS tools to smartphones and tablets to sophisticated sensors – and many more – act as force multipliers for data growth.<br /><br />But you don't need to be Google or having Big Data problem to take benefits of NoSQL databases.",
    "technologies.nosql.content.h2": "NoSQL is about performance and scalability",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p2": "Because the way they are structured, relational databases usually scale vertically – a single server has to host the entire database to ensure reliability and continuous availability of data. This gets expensive quickly, places limits on scale, and creates a relatively small number of failure points for database infrastructure.<br />The solution is to scale horizontally, by adding servers instead of concentrating more capacity in a single server. NoSQL databases are cloud-friendly, offering high performance, high availability of data and high scalability at a little cost.",
    "technologies.nosql.content.h3": "NoSQL is agile and pragmatic",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p3": "Long gone is the twelve-to-eighteen month waterfall development cycle. Now small teams work in agile sprints, iterating quickly and pushing code every week or two, even every day. Relational databases requires schemas and may cause significant downtime each time a migration is needed. NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. That makes it easy to make significant application changes in real-time, without worrying about service interruptions – which means development is faster, code integration is more reliable, and less database administrator time is needed.",
    "technologies.nosql.content.h4": "MongoDB is cost-friendly",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p4": "MongoDB is free, No more license.<br />Deploying MongoDB drastically lowers operational costs, since it's free, it's reduce administration time and it's speed up development time because it maps directly stored data to objects in modern objects-oriented languages.",
    "technologies.nosql.content.h5": "MongoDB is our choice",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p5": "MongoDB is technically on the cutting edge, has the largest and the most active community and is backed by a solid company even if the technology is open-source. <strong>We also have a 7 man-year experience implementing a portfolio management system that relies on MongoDB, that make us confident and fluent about the technology.</strong>",
    "technologies.nosql.content.p6": "<q>MongoDB is currently used by big names, such as Cisco, LinkedIn, SAP and MTV.</q><br /><br /> But, NoSQL is a completely new approach and may not suit all the cases, we can help to understand it better and offer you some guidance in your decision making.",

    "technologies.datavisualization.content.h2": "A picture is worth a thousand words.",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.p2": "The ability to understand and extract value from data is hugely easier and efficient when done through a Data Visualization rather than from looking at the raw data. It exposes something new about the underlying patterns and relationships contained within the data.",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.h3": "Accessible everywhere",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.p3": "D3.js is the perfect tool for Data-Visualization by helping you to bring your data to life using HTML5, CSS3 and SVG. It is an Open Source JavaScript framework that works seamlessly with existing web technologies, making your data accessible from everwhere through your browser.",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.h4": "Cost-effective and relevant",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.p4": "D3.js is not a graphics library, nor a data processing library. It does not have pre-built charts that limit creativity. Instead, it has tools that make the connection between data and graphics easy. It sits right between the two, the perfect place for a library meant for data-visualization.",
    "technologies.datavisualization.content.p5": "We use <q>D3.js</q> to help you to understand and <q>extract value</q> from your data.<br /><br />We let us take advantage of your refined data by interacting with it<br /><q>everywhere, at everytime, on everything</q>.",
    "technologies.frontend.h": "Rich Web Application",
    "technologies.frontend.p": "React",
    "technologies.frontend.content.p1": "Gmail, first released in 2004, was a pioneer as a rich web application.<br />Crafting such applications was considered expensive to develop and complicated to maintain, and only big web players like Google were able to invested in it.<br /><br />Since then numerous frameworks were created; EmberJS, BackboneJS, KnockoutJS are the most recognized, and among them <q>AngularJS</q> and <q>React</q> are becoming predominant for professional web development.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.p2": "<q>AngularJS and React are a very high quality foundation for building great apps, and doing it quickly.</q><br /><br />The growing popularity of these frameworks is huge and companies as big as well-known Banks are on the verge to take the plunge.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.p3": "<br /><q>The reality is that AngularJS and React are winning the frontend framework war.</q>",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.h1": "Backed by Google",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.p1": "AngularJS is built by Google which has one of the strongest engineering cultures.<br />Combine that with the resources that they have and with the power of open source and you get a really powerful mix.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.h2": "Increase productivity, reducing costs",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.p2": "Having the ability to scaffold a project quickly with all that you need is key to getting started and producing efficiently. AngularJS came about to standardize web application structure and provide a future template for how client-side apps should be developed. This not only allows you to quickly assemble something up, but it lays the roots for something way bigger to evolve.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.h3": "Focus on testing",
    "technologies.frontend.content.angularjs.p3": "Having testable code is part of AngularJS philosophy.<br />Making it easy to write tests is crucial.<br />No matter how good the code is – if it’s not testable, it’s useless in the long run.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.h1": "Supported by Facebook",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.p1": "React is now open source, but it was first developed at Facebook for internal purposes. After a while, Facebook engineers realized that they created something truly awesome and decided to share their project with the world. It is currently, in addition to Facebook, used by Instagram, The New York Times and Khan Academy in production.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.h2": "Blazing fast",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.p2": "React creates its own virtual DOM where the components actually live. This approach gives an enormous flexibility and an amazing gains in performance because React calculates what changes need to be made in the DOM beforehand and updates the DOM tree accordingly. This way, React avoids costly DOM operations and makes updates in a very efficient manner.",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.h3": "Reusable and cost-effective",
    "technologies.frontend.content.react.p3": "React gives the ability to create our own components that can be later reused and combined. This is a tremendeous productivity boost and let React scale better with complexity by only dealing with small components with encapsulated behavior.",

They double the requests per second and decrease by 35% the average response time.<br />Groupon has decrease by 50% the loading time of their pages after rewrote their application server with Node.js.<br /><strong>We became 6 times faster after a migration from MySQL/Rails to MongoDB/Node.js.</strong><br />LinkedIn moved from Rails to Node.js and have a 27 servers cut (on 30).<br />The ability to process many requests/seconds with low response times make Node.js a great choice for modern web applications that do lots of I/O processing on the client.",
    "technologies.backend.content.h3": "High productivity",
    "technologies.backend.content.p3": "Paypal observes that a Node.js application is built almost twice as fast with fewer people.<br />The Node.js ecosystem is extremely prolific: new tools appear almost every day, increasing productivity. More than 65000 modules are currently available and its growth rate is faster than other’s ecosystems.<br />Since the framework was built for the commonly used JavaScript, the barriers to entry are remarkably low<br />and using one language allows code reuse between client and server, reducing the gap among front-end and back-end developers, introducing full stack developers.",
    "technologies.backend.content.h4": "Flexible and Cost effective",
    "technologies.backend.content.p4": "JavaScript is widely standardized, simple and has a quick learning curve that implies easy and natural migration from more complex languages.<br />One language all the way down makes it easier for a single programmer to work on either side of the wire; there's less of a mental shift.<br />For project managers, the trend would make it easier to move developer resources between the front end and the back end if a common language is used on both.",
